# This is VAE-Flow part 
- so in this repo i am understand the varitional auto encoder implementation of pyramid flow model archtecture.


## Dataset 
- `image_dataset` --> so in the image dataset have image and text in the form of dictionary.

- `video_dataset` -> in the video dataset, video have the latent and text have latent.
    to learn more. go to `Docs/dataset.md` directory.

```
# This is the base file of the VAE Architecture.
--> modeling_resnet 
--> modeling_lpips 
--> modeling_loss
--> modeling_enc_dec 
--> modeling_discriminator 
--> modeling_causal_conv 
--> modeling_block
```
